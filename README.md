# Build your own GPX Track Repository Web Site

This repository includes some markup to present your GPX tracks nicely on Github Pages.

The code uses:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Theme based on the minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)
- [Future: Lunr Search](http://lunrjs.com)
- [Sample tracks](https://www.inslichtruecken.de)


## Getting started

Have a look at the [set-up instructions](./general/set-up-instructions.html).
This will give you a good idea how to clone the repo, get a local environment up and running and perform the basic configuration.

On [this page](./general/how-to-add-tracks.html) you will find instructions how to create a new track including its description.
